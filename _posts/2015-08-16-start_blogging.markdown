## Background
Since my development career started I tried out different blogging platforms, from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/home) to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to [Medium](https://medium.com) but for some reason they didn't work for me

## Solution
I was looking for a more familiar writing experience, what I was looking for was  writing but for programmers.

Checking [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages 101") felt like I've hit the Jackpot.

It was quite easy:

1. Create a repository that's called **_username_.github.io**, where **_username_** matches your github username
2. Clone the repository
3. Write Hello World into index.html
4. Push the repository
5. Check [http://username.github.io](http://username.github.io)

I now have a <s>blog</s> github page up and running, what's next?

### What's next?
Stay tuned for the next post.
